🔹اصل شصت و هشتم

رئیس جمهور برای اعمال انجام یافته در اجرای وظایف خویش، جز در صورت ارتكاب خیانت به كشور مسئول نیست. وی فقط توسط مجلسین با رأی‌گیری علنی اكثریت مطلق اعضای تشكیل دهنده آنها مورد پیگرد قرار می‌گیرد و توسط دیوان عالی عدالت محاكمه می‌گردد.
🔹Article 68

The President shall not be responsible for the actions performed in the discharge of his duties, except in cases where he has committed treason against the country. He shall be held accountable only by the two houses of the Parliament by an open vote of the absolute majority of the members of each house and shall be tried by the Supreme Court.
