🔹Article 11

At the suggestion of the government during parliamentary sessions or at the joint proposal of the two houses of parliament published in the official newspaper, the President can submit any bill related to the organization of public powers, reforms related to the country's economic or social policies, reforms related to public services involved in these policies, or approval of a treaty that will not adversely affect the performance of institutions, to a referendum.
When a referendum is held at the government's suggestion, the government delivers a speech to each of the houses, and negotiations take place after the speech.
If a referendum leads to the approval of a bill, the President signs the law within fifteen days after the announcement of the election results and issues an executive order for its implementation.
