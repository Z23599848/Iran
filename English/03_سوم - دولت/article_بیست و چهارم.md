🔹Article 61

Basic laws, before being signed and issued as executive orders, as well as internal regulations of the National Assembly before implementation, must be referred to the Constitutional Council for its opinion on their conformity with the Constitution.

To this end, laws may also be referred to the Constitutional Council by the President, Prime Minister, Speaker of the National Assembly, Speaker of the Senate, or sixty representatives or senators, before being signed and issued as executive orders.

In the cases envisaged in the above two paragraphs, the Constitutional Council must give its opinion on the matter within one month. However, in case of urgency, the aforementioned period shall be reduced to eight days at the request of the government.

In such cases, the referral to the Constitutional Council suspends the deadline.
